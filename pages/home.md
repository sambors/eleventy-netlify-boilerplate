My name is Szymon, I am a design engineer working in the automotive sensors industry. My focus is in *product design and manufacturing*. I live in beautiful (and cold) Chicago, Illinois.

At work, I design solutions to meet customersâ€™ needs. Outside of work, I love to bike, draw, cook, and rock climb.
